The Temple is also in the vicinity of the Protectorates of Wadi Al- Rayan, Wadi Al-Hitan (The valley of the whales) and Tunis Village, this rare and unique architectural and astronomical phenomenon is as important as the same phenomenon that happens in Abu Simpel in Aswan.\nThe archaeological site will start welcoming guests for free at 6:00 am.
